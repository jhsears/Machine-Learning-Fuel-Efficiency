# Machine Learning: Final Project

Instructions on the final project report:
You will analyze a specific dataset using different methods that we discussed in class, your
report should contain the following:
  1.  Abstract: Mention briefly what the study objective is, what the data is like (for exam-
      ple, the sample size, major characteristics of the sample subjects and the key variables
      included) and what are the statistical methods that you used in the paper. Then, you
      should focus on summarizing the findings.
  2.  Introduction: Describe details about how the data set was collected and the variables
      in the data set. Also describe the scientific questions of interest. Give an overview of
      how you will address the scientific questions using the appropriate statistical learning
      methods.
  3.  Methods: Describe how you used the methods that you learned in class to analyze the
      data set. Explain why you choose those methods.
  4.  Results and Discussion: Summarize your analysis results in tables and/or figures. Based
      on the analysis results, provide conclusions to address the questions of interest. Discuss
      any limitations of your study.

# Predictive Classification of Automobile Fuel Efficiency

Abstract
The objective of this project is to determine the best – or most plausible – method of predicting the 
classification of an automobile’s fuel efficiency in terms of a high or low measurement of miles per 
gallon (mpg). The data analyzed included the weight, year built, country of origin, engine specifications 
(cylinders, displacement horsepower) and outputs (acceleration, mpg) for 392 different automobiles 
built between 1970 and 1982. The median mpg was calculated to classify each vehicle as one with a 
high or low mpg, and therefore bad or good fuel efficiency. Feature selection based on univariate and 
bivariate analysis was performed and the labeled data set was used to train and evaluate four different 
classification approaches including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The LDA model performed the best in 
terms of error rate and variance, supporting the noted separability of classes amongst the variables. 
With an accuracy rating of almost 90%, the LDA model is considered a very plausible predictor for 
classifying an automobile’s fuel efficiency.
